 Class: TY-AIML
 Project Title: Rock Paper Scissors Game
 Technology Used: Python, Tkinter, random
📌 1. Introduction
The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a Python-based GUI application designed to simulate the 
traditional hand game between the user and the computer. This application features 
interactive buttons, score tracking, and automatic decision logic to determine the winner 
after each round.
🔧 2. Tools & Technologies
Component Description
Language: Python 3.x
GUI Toolkit: Tkinter (Python built-in)
Library Used: random
IDE: Any Python-supported IDE like IDLE, VS Code, or PyCharm
Platform: Windows (with Python installed)
🧠 3. Objectives
• To implement a GUI-based interactive game.
• To enhance skills in event-driven programming using Python.
• To demonstrate decision-making logic and GUI design.
• To create an engaging and educational gaming experience.
🗂 4. Functional Overview
 Features:
• GUI interface with buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
• Random move generation for the computer.
• Display of result and choice for each player.
• Score tracking for wins, losses, and ties.
• Reset option to clear scores.
⚙️ 5. Working Mechanism
 Step-by-step Workflow:
1. GUI window displays with all control buttons.
2. Player clicks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. Computer randomly selects a choice using the random library.
4. Logic compares both choices and determines the result.
5. Result and updated scores are displayed on screen.
🔑 6. Code Overview
 Main Components:
from tkinter import *
import random
 Logic and Event Handling:
• Functions to handle user input and generate computer response.
• Update GUI with the result and score.
🌟 7. Output Screenshot (Example)
• Example Output:
User chooses: Rock
Computer chooses: Scissors
Result: You Win!
Score: Player 1 - Computer 0 - Ties 0
⚠️ 8. Limitations
• Only includes 3 fixed options: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
• No multiplayer mode.
• GUI not responsive for mobile screens.
• Game restarts when window is closed.
🌟 9. Improvements Suggested
• Add animation or sound effects for better engagement.
• Add leaderboard or high score system.
• Expand to multiplayer or AI difficulty levels.
• Improve GUI responsiveness.
🧠 10. Learnings & Outcomes
• Understood event-driven programming in Python.
• Gained hands-on experience with GUI development using Tkinter.
• Applied basic logic structures to build an interactive application.
• Improved problem-solving and debugging skills.
📌 11. Conclusion
The Rock Paper Scissors Game successfully showcases a simple yet engaging way to apply 
Python programming knowledge in a real-world scenario. It demonstrates the use of GUI 
design, randomness, and decision-making logic in building interactive software.
